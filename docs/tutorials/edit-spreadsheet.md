# Tutorial: Edit collection data in a spreadsheet

The tutorial will guide you in editing collection data in a spreadsheet program such as Google Sheets or Excel.


### Before you start

* **Create a spreadsheet.** For this tutorial you will need a spreadsheet to edit. The easiest way to create one is to follow the [recipe on creating a Google Sheet for collection data](../recipes/create-google-sheet). You can also create a blank spreadsheet and then fill in the sheets and sheet headers as you go. 
* **Review the [Paradicms data model](../introduction/data-model).**
* Optionally, **review the [reference documentation on Paradicms-formatted spreadsheets](../reference/spreadsheet-format.md).**
