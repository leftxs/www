# Apps

Paradicms apps are statically-generated, web-based user interfaces for browsing and searching data encoded in the [Paradicms data model](data-model).

Apps are usually generated via [GitHub Actions](/docs/reference/github-actions), which extract data from a source like Google Sheets, transform it to the Paradicms data model, and feed the data to an app-specific static site generator. The result is a set of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files which can be deployed to a static file hosting service such as GitHub Pages.

See the [apps reference](/docs/reference/apps) for more information on the apps currently available in Paradicms.
